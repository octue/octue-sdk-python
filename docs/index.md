Twined helps scientists and engineers focus on their analyses instead of wrestling with infrastructure. Whether you need
to **run published analyses out of the box**, **share your own models and code as reusable services**, or **deploy
everything securely in your own environment**, Twined streamlines the process so you can spend more time on the science.

## Where to start

### Using services

Access ready-made scientific analyses instantly, with no coding, cloud setup, or DevOps required. Run them once or thousands of times, and connect them directly into your research workflows and pipelines.

### Creating services

Package your analysis code or models as production-ready services, without needing infrastructure expertise. Share them with colleagues, collaborators, or the wider community.

### Managing infrastructure

Deploy Twined services in your private cloud with just two pre-configured Terraform modules. Control costs, manage access, and integrate with your existing scientific data and digital tools.

## Stats

- 250,000+ analyses run
- 100s of services built
- 6 years in development
- 12 countries - users across the world

## Twined in the wild

- WindPioneers - [WindQuest](https://wind-pioneers.com/what-we-do/windquest-smarter-tools/): Twined powers the simulation infrastructure behind the WindQuest application, supporting design of hundreds of wind farms worldwide with over 250,000 Energy Yield Assessment (EYA) scenarios run to date.
- OST Zurich - [Aerosense](https://rtdt.ai/) (now part of RTDT Labs): The Twined framework was used to underpin digital twin and data infrastructure, enabling a novel turbine blade sensing technology to reach commercial readiness, now spun out and deployed internationally.

Twined helps scientists and engineers focus on their analyses instead of wrestling with infrastructure. Whether you need
to **run published analyses out of the box**, **share your own models and code as reusable services**, or **deploy
everything securely in your own environment**, Twined streamlines the process so you can spend more time on the science.

## Where to start

### 1 - Using services

Access ready-made scientific analyses instantly, with no coding, cloud setup, or DevOps required. Run them once or
thousands of times, and connect them directly into your research workflows and pipelines. Try the [getting started
guide](using_services/getting_started.md).

### 2 - Creating services

Package your analysis code or models as production-ready services, without needing infrastructure expertise. Share them
with colleagues, collaborators, or the wider community. Try the [getting started guide](creating_services/getting_started.md).

### 3 - Managing infrastructure

Deploy Twined services in your private cloud with just two pre-configured Terraform modules. Control costs, manage
access, and integrate with your existing scientific data and digital tools. Try the [getting started guide](managing_infrastructure/getting_started.md).

## Twined in the wild

- WindPioneers - [WindQuest](https://wind-pioneers.com/what-we-do/windquest-smarter-tools/): Twined powers the simulation infrastructure behind the WindQuest application, supporting design of hundreds of wind farms worldwide with over 250,000 Energy Yield Assessment (EYA) scenarios run to date.
- OST Zurich - [Aerosense](https://rtdt.ai/) (now part of RTDT Labs): The Twined framework was used to underpin digital twin and data infrastructure, enabling a novel turbine blade sensing technology to reach commercial readiness, now spun out and deployed internationally.

# Version History {#chapter-version-history}

See our [releases on GitHub.](https://github.com/octue/octue-sdk-python/releases)

## Semantic versioning

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) so you can see when
new releases make breaking changes or just add new features or bug
fixes. Breaking changes are highlighted in our pull request descriptions
and release notes.

!!! important

    Note that `octue` is still in beta, so its major version number remains
    at 0 (i.e. `0.y.z`). This means that, for now, both breaking changes and
    new features are denoted by an increase in the minor version number (`y`
    in `x.y.z`). When we come out of beta, breaking changes will be denoted
    by an increase in the major version number (`x` in `x.y.z`).

## Deprecated code

When code is deprecated, it will still work but a deprecation warning
will be issued with a suggestion on how to update it. After an
adjustment period, deprecations will be removed from the codebase
according to the [code removal schedule](https://github.com/octue/octue-sdk-python/issues/415). This constitutes a breaking change.

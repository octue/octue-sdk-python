More information on downloading datafiles
=========================================

- To avoid unnecessary data transfer and costs, cloud datafiles are not downloaded locally
  `until necessary <datafile.html#automatic-lazy-downloading>`_.
- When downloaded, they are downloaded by default to a temporary local file that will exist at least as long as the
  python session is running
- Calling ``Datafile.download`` or using ``Datafile.local_path`` again will not re-download the file
- Any changes made to the datafile via the ``Datafile.open`` method are made to the local copy and then synced with
  the cloud object

.. warning::

    External changes to cloud files will not be synced locally unless the datafile is re-instantiated.

- If you want a cloud datafile to be downloaded to a permanent location, you can do one of:

    .. code-block:: python

        datafile.download(local_path="my/local/path.csv")

        datafile.local_path = "my/local/path.csv"

- To pre-set a permanent download location on instantiation, run:

    .. code-block:: python

        datafile = Datafile("gs://my-bucket/path/to/file.dat", local_path="my/local/path.csv")

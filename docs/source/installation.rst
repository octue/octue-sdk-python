Installation
============

To use the Octue SDK from within your Octue python application, simply add:

.. code-block::

    octue==x.y.z

to your ``requirements.txt`` or ``setup.py`` file, where x.y.z. is your preferred (we recommend the latest stable)
version of the SDK.

If you've used the 'octue-app-python' application as your base template, you should already have the SDK installed
(`see how it's done in the example app. <https://github.com/octue/octue-app-python>`_)


Just want to pip install?
=========================
Just run

.. code-block::

    pip install octue

Using Poetry?
=============

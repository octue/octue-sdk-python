==================================
Datafiles, datasets, and manifests
==================================

One of the main features of ``octue`` is to make data management easy. There are three main data classes in the SDK to
make this possible.

``Datafile``
============
:doc:`A single local or cloud file. <datafile>`


``Dataset``
===========
:doc:`A set of related datafiles <dataset>` that exist in the same location, typically produced by or for one operation in an analysis.


``Manifest``
============
:doc:`A set of related datasets <manifest>` that exist anywhere, typically produced by or for one analysis.

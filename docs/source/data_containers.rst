Datafiles, datasets, and manifests
==================================
One of the main features of ``octue`` is making using, creating, and sharing scientific datasets easy. There are three
main data classes in the SDK that do this.

- **Datafile** - :doc:`a single local or cloud file <datafile>` and its metadata.

- **Dataset** - :doc:`a set of related datafiles <dataset>` that exist in the same location, plus metadata.

- **Manifest** - :doc:`a set of related datasets <manifest>` that exist anywhere, plus metadata. Typically produced by
  or for one analysis.

Updating a Twined service
=========================

This page describes how to update an existing, deployed Twined service - in other words, how to deploy a new Twined
service revision.

We assume that:

- Your service's repository is on GitHub and you have push access to it
- The `standard Twined service deployment GitHub Actions workflow <https://github.com/octue/workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-twined-service.yml>`_
  is set up in the repository and being used to build and push the service image to the artifact registry on merge of a
  pull request into the ``main`` branch (see an example `here <https://github.com/octue/example-service-kueue/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml>`_)
- A release workflow is set up that will tag and release the new service revision on GitHub (see an example
  `here <https://github.com/octue/example-service-kueue/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml>`_)

Instructions
-------------

1. Check out and pull the ``main`` branch to make sure you're up to date with the latest changes

   .. code-block:: shell

       git checkout main
       git pull

2. Install your service locally so you can run the tests and your development environment can lint the code etc.:

   .. code-block:: shell

       poetry install

3. Set up `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ to enforce code quality:

   .. code-block:: shell

       pre-commit install && pre-commit install -t commit-msg

4. Check out a new branch so you can work independently of any other work on the code happening at the same time

   .. code-block:: shell

       git checkout -b my-new-feature

5. Add and make changes to your app's code as needed, committing each self-contained change. Use the `Conventional
   Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_ commit message format so the new version for your service
   can be automatically calculated.

   .. code-block:: shell

       git add a-new-file another-new-file
       git commit -m "Your commit message"
       ...repeat...

   Push your commits frequently so your work is backed up on GitHub

   .. code-block:: shell

       git push

6. Write any new tests you need to verify your code works and update any old tests as needed

7. Run the tests locally using ``pytest`` and fix anything that makes them fail

8. Update the `semantic version <https://semver.org/>`_ of your app. This communicates to anyone updating from a
   previous version of the service whether they can use it as before or if there might be changes they need to make to
   their own code or data first.

   - ``poetry version patch`` for a bug fix or small non-code change
   - ``poetry version minor`` for a new feature
   - ``poetry version major`` for a breaking change

   Don't forget to commit this change, too.

9. When you're ready to review the changes, head to GitHub and open a pull request of your branch into ``main``. This
   makes it easy for you and anyone else to see what's changed. Check the "Files Changed" tab to make sure everything's
   there and consistent (it's easy to forget to push a commit). Ask your colleagues to review the code if required.

10. When you're ready to release the new version of your service, check that the GitHub checks have passed. These ensure
    code quality, that the tests pass, and that the new version number is correct.

11. Merge the pull request into ``main``. This will run the deployment workflow (usually called ``cd`` - continuous
    deployment), making the new version of the service available to everyone.

12. Check that the deployment workflow has run successfully (this can take a few minutes). You can check the progress in
    the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository

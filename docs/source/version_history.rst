Version History
===============
See our `releases on GitHub. <https://github.com/octue/octue-sdk-python/releases>`_ Note that ``octue`` is still in
beta, so both breaking changes and features are denoted by an increase in the minor version number. This means the major
version number can remain at 0, denoting a beta package. Breaking changes are marked clearly in pull requests and
release notes.

Deprecated code
===============
When code is deprecated, it will still work but a deprecation warning will be issued with a suggestion on how to update
it. After an adjustment period, deprecations will be removed according to the `code removal schedule <https://github.com/octue/octue-sdk-python/issues/415>`_.

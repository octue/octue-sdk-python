# Datafiles, datasets, and manifests

One of the main features of Twined is making using, creating, and
sharing scientific datasets easy. There are three main data classes in
the that do this.

- **Datafile** - [a single local or cloud file](/datafile) and its metadata.
- **Dataset** - [a set of related datafiles](/dataset) that exist in the same location, plus metadata.
- **Manifest** - [a set of related datasets](/manifest) that exist anywhere, plus metadata. Typically produced by or for
  one analysis.

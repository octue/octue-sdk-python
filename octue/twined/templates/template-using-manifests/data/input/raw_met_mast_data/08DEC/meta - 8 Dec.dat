Yes, this is a *really* bad way for anyone to decide to store metadata... And CSVs are a horribly inefficient way of
storing numeric data (as well as being prone corruption e.g. if data has missing values, or strings have commas, etc).

If you're creating datasets, don't do this. It's a completely custom file format, totally crazy and not easily machine
readable.

Do yourself, and everybody else, a favour and write your metadata as JSON, and if you have heavyweight numeric data
consider HDF5 (or netCDF, or similar) formats which will be more compact and robust than CSVs.

Why are we giving you this example, then?

Because we've seen this, and much worse, many times in real life. We think it's better for examples to be based on
actual real data, rather than the perfect ideal scenario.

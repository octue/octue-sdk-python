# octue-sdk-python <span><img src="http://slurmed.com/fanart/javier/213_purple-fruit-snake.gif" alt="Purple Fruit Snake" width="100"/></span>

Utilities for running python based data services, digital twins and applications. [Documentation is here!](https://octue-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Based on the [twined](https://twined.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for data validation.

## Installation and usage
For usage as a scientist or engineer, run one of the following commands in your environment:
```shell
pip install octue
```

```shell
poetry add octue
```

The command line interface (CLI) can then be accessed via:
```shell
octue --help
```

### Deprecated code
When code is deprecated, it will still work but a deprecation warning will be issued with a suggestion on how to update
it. After an adjustment period, deprecations will be removed from the codebase according to the [code removal schedule](https://github.com/octue/octue-sdk-python/issues/415).
This constitutes a breaking change.

## Developer notes

### Installation
We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as our package manager. For development, run the following from the
repository root, which will editably install the package:

```bash
poetry install -E dataflow -E hdf5
```

Then run the tests to check everything's working.

### Testing
These environment variables need to be set to run the tests:
* `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/absolute/path/to/service/account/file.json`
* `TEST_PROJECT_NAME=<name-of-google-cloud-project-to-run-pub-sub-tests-on>`

Then, from the repository root, run
```bash
python3 -m unittest
```

**Documentation for use of the library is [here](https://octue-python-sdk.readthedocs.io). You don't need to pay attention to the following unless you plan to develop `octue-sdk-python` itself.**

### Pre-Commit

You need to install pre-commit to get the hooks working. Do:
```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Once that's done, each time you make a commit, the following checks are made:

- valid github repo and files
- code style
- import order
- PEP8 compliance
- documentation build
- branch naming convention

Upon failure, the commit will halt. **Re-running the commit will automatically fix most issues** except:

- The flake8 checks... hopefully over time Black (which fixes most things automatically already) will negate need for it.
- You'll have to fix documentation yourself prior to a successful commit (there's no auto fix for that!!).

You can run pre-commit hooks without making a commit, too, like:
```
pre-commit run black --all-files
```
or
```
# -v gives verbose output, useful for figuring out why docs won't build
pre-commit run build-docs -v
```


### Contributing

- Please raise an issue on the board (or add your $0.02 to an existing issue) so the maintainers know
what's happening and can advise / steer you.

- Create a fork of octue-sdk-python, undertake your changes on a new branch, (see `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for branch naming conventions). To run tests and make commits,
you'll need to do something like:
```
git clone <your_forked_repo_address>    # Fetches the repo to your local machine
cd octue-sdk-python                     # Move into the repo directory
pyenv virtualenv 3.8 myenv              # Makes a virtual environment for you to install the dev tools into. Use any python >= 3.8
pyend activate myenv                    # Activates the virtual environment so you don't screw up other installations
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt     # Installs the testing and code formatting utilities
pre-commit install                      # Installs the pre-commit code formatting hooks in the git repo
```

- Adopt a Test Driven Development approach to implementing new features or fixing bugs.

- Ask the maintainers *where* to make your pull request. We'll create a version branch, according to the
roadmap, into which you can make your PR. We'll help review the changes and improve the PR.

- Once checks have passed, test coverage of the new code is 100%, documentation is updated and the Review is passed, we'll merge into the version branch.

- Once all the roadmapped features for that version are done, we'll release.


### Release process

The process for creating a new release is as follows:

1. Check out a branch for the next version, called `vX.Y.Z`
2. Create a Pull Request into the `main` branch.
3. Undertake your changes, committing and pushing to branch `vX.Y.Z`
4. Ensure that documentation is updated to match changes, and increment the changelog. **Pull requests which do not update documentation will be refused.**
5. Ensure that test coverage is sufficient. **Pull requests that decrease test coverage will be refused.**
6. Ensure code meets style guidelines (pre-commit scripts and flake8 tests will fail otherwise)
7. Address Review Comments on the PR
8. Ensure the version in `setup.py` is correct and matches the branch version.
9. Merge to master. Successful test, doc build, flake8 and a new version number will automatically create the release on pypi.
10. Go to code > releases and create a new release on GitHub at the same SHA.


## Documents

### Building documents automatically

The documentation will build automatically in a pre-configured environment when you make a commit.

In fact, the way pre-commit works, you won't be allowed to make the commit unless the documentation builds,
this way we avoid getting broken documentation pushed to the main repository on any commit sha, so we can rely on
builds working.


### Building documents manually

**If you did need to build the documentation**

Install `doxgen`. On a mac, that's `brew install doxygen`; other systems may differ.

Install sphinx and other requirements for building the docs:
```
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

Run the build process:
```
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build
```
